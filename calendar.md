    title: Visions of Human-Computer Interaction
    content:
      - |
        These "vision" papers challenge a dominant pattern,
        propose going beyond mimicking prior technologies,
        or cast a vision of future technologies.
        This is certainly not an exhaustive set of such papers,
        just a set chosen to be interesting and appropriate.

        ### Non-Standard Reading Format

        Each student has two responsibilities.

        First, organize into groups of 2 or 3 to briefly present one of the above vision papers.

        `<http://docs.google.com/document/d/1PwswUeGCwjvzdnHlu4Ei6NMkLlSeaQy6Zom7nRCu1M0/edit?usp=sharing>`

        It is critical to remember most people will not have read the paper you are presenting.
        It is therefore your responsibility to explain the vision.
        One useful way of breaking down and explaining the vision might be to discuss these four points:

        - What was the status quo at the time the authors wrote this?
        - What was the author's vision of future technologies?
        - How has this vision played out since this publication?
        - How might this vision continue to play out in the future?

        Submit your presentation as 3 to 4 slides in PDF, PPT, or PPTX format:

        `<https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1021534/assignments/3121308>`

        Second, individually read at least one more of the above vision papers.

        No reading report is necessary, but everyone picking a second paper benefits in-class discussion.
        Note that some of these are quite long.
        We are assigning them so that you can see these visions and explore them appropriately.
        You can and should skim according to your needs.

    title: Contributions and Methods in HCI
    content:

        Read the following framing papers:

        <ul class="readings" markdown="block">
        <li class="paper" markdown="block">
        Jacob O. Wobbrock, Julie A. Kientz. [Research Contributions in Human-Computer Interaction]({{ page.paper_url.wobbrock2016 }}). Interactions, 2016.
        </li>
        <li class="paper" markdown="block">
        James Fogarty. [Code and Contribution in Interactive Systems Research]({{ page.paper_url.fogarty2017 }}). CHI 2017.
        </li>
        </ul>

        Below are examples of papers from CHI 2017 that correspond to Wobbrock's types of research contribution in HCI.

        Select two to review, focusing on papers that are most likely to correspond to the contribution style(s) relevant in your project.
        You should not focus on the details of these papers, but rather their organization of the research and how it is presented.
        We surface them to provide concrete examples of the contributions, but our in-class discussion will focus on the framing papers.
